    <div id="secondiv">second</div>
    <span class="teacher"></span>


    
</body>
</html>


--->  CSS IS HERE //

.sir-1{
    color: red;
}
.teacher{
    background-color: aqua;
}

---> NOTE :- Id and class are not element but it is "atrributes"

             Each defferent element have different "ID" forever ..
             we can define Id in css with ( # )
             we can creat perticuler links  in server like google etc with # sign

             but sometime two and more different element have same "class" and also multiple "classes"
             we can define class in css with ( . )
            for example (class) :- <div class="abc">...</div>
                       <div class="abs kgf-qp">...</div> 
                       (we can multiple class name with give a space between name)
